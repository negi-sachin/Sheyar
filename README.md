Tech Stack:
1. WebRTC
2. NodeJS
3. HTML,CSS,JS

Reason behind this app:

I used to share files between computer and phone through USB, Gmail, Drive, or WhatsApp which is quite tedious and sometimes it wastes a lot of time.
Therefore, I developed a site Sheyar, where you can share files between two remote locations. You can share N number of files of any type.
Works smoothly in chrome and Firefox. And the most amazing thing about this tool is- it doesn't compress or degrade the file size or quality.
It's very simple, fast and Easy to use.
